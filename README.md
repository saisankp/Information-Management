# Information-Management
Information Models I've completed using UML, XML with XQuery as well as ER models implemented as a mySQL database.

The `Bord-Gais-Information-Model` directory contains an information model which uses UML, XML and XQuery, and was developed during the module Information Management I (CSU22041).

The `Growtopia-Vending-Machine-ER-Model` directory contains an ER Model about a vending machine business in [Growtopia](Growtopia), and is implemented as a mySQL database. This was developed during the module Information Management II (CSU22041).
